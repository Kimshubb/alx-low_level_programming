The approach used is to create a shared library that intercepts the call to the rand() function used by the gm program to generate the winning numbers. Thus standard implementation of rand() is replaced with with a custom implementation that always generates the numbers we want to win.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

Write a shared library that intercepts the call to rand() using the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. The library should define a new implementation for the rand() function that always generates the winning numbers we want.

Compile the shared library and upload it to the server.

Write a shell script that sets the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to load the shared library and executes the gm program with the winning numbers.

Upload the shell script to the server.

Wait for the mole to execute the shell script, which will set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable and execute the gm program with the winning numbers.
